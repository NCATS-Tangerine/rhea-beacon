      The file was downloaded and is used to generate results for the concepts
      endpoints of this beacon. We only use the subset of this file that
      intersects with chebiId_name.tsv, as anything outside that intersection
      will not be recognized by rhea-db.

      "ChEBI is stored in a relational database and we currently provide all-star
      and 3-star ChEBI table in a flat-file tab delimited format. There are various
      spreadsheet tools available to import this into a relational database.
      The files are stored in the same structure as the relational database."

      This file was created by StarInformatics to speed up the process of getting
      RHEA reaction names. I cannot remember how exactly we created it..
